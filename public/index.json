This simulator shows both approaches because they answer different questions:\nFrequentist: \u0026ldquo;If we repeated this experiment many times, how often would we see this difference by chance?\u0026rdquo; Bayesian: \u0026ldquo;Given what we\u0026rsquo;ve observed, what\u0026rsquo;s the probability that B is actually better than A?\u0026rdquo; What Are Credible Intervals? The 95% credible interval means: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re 95% confident the true value is in this range.\u0026rdquo;\n",
