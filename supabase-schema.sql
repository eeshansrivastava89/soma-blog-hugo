-- 3. Analysis Views
-- ====================
-- Note: We don't create separate views for completions/starts/failures
-- Just query posthog_events with WHERE event = 'puzzle_completed' etc.
-- This keeps the schema simple and flexible.

-- View: Variant Statistics Summary
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_variant_stats AS
SELECT
  variant,
  feature_flag_response,
  COUNT(DISTINCT distinct_id) as unique_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_user_ids,
  COUNT(*) as total_completions,
  AVG(completion_time_seconds) as avg_completion_time,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY completion_time_seconds) as median_completion_time,

-- View: Conversion Funnel (Event-Based)

) funnel_stages
ORDER BY variant, stage_order;

COMMENT ON VIEW v_conversion_funnel IS 'Event-based funnel: started events → completed events → users who repeated (started again after completing)';

-- 4. Helper Functions
-- ====================

-- Function to get user percentile by variant
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fn_get_user_percentile(
  p_user_time NUMERIC,
  p_variant TEXT
)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE
  percentile NUMERIC;

    )
  INTO percentile
  FROM posthog_events
  WHERE event = 'puzzle_completed'
    AND variant = p_variant
    AND completion_time_seconds IS NOT NULL;

  RETURN COALESCE(percentile, 0);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION fn_get_user_percentile IS 'Calculate percentile rank for a user time within their variant';

-- ====================
-- 5. Sample Queries for Testing
-- ====================

-- After running this schema, test with:
/*

-- Check event counts by type
SELECT event, COUNT(*)
FROM posthog_events
GROUP BY event
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Check variant distribution
SELECT variant, feature_flag_response, COUNT(*)
FROM posthog_events
WHERE event = 'puzzle_completed'
GROUP BY variant, feature_flag_response;

-- Get variant stats
SELECT * FROM v_variant_stats;

-- Get conversion funnel
SELECT * FROM v_conversion_funnel;

-- Get user percentile
SELECT fn_get_user_percentile(5.5, 'A') as percentile;

-- Recent completions (just query the main table)
SELECT uuid, distinct_id, variant, completion_time_seconds, total_guesses_count, timestamp
FROM posthog_events
WHERE event = 'puzzle_completed' AND variant IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- All puzzle events for a user
SELECT event, variant, completion_time_seconds, timestamp
FROM posthog_events
WHERE distinct_id = '019a1a0b-49b1-710b-9bcb-35c254f1749b'
ORDER BY timestamp;
